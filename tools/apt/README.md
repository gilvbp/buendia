This directory contains the apt configuration necessary to make `sudo apt
install openjdk-7-jdk` work on Debian stretch, because OpenJDK 7 is required
for OpenMRS 1.x, but is no longer available on recent Debian.

See the [Debian stretch install notes](../../openmrs/README-debian.md) for more
details.
